				<h3>History of the city</h3>
				<div><p>Walnut Hills, since its founding, has been known for its cultural, ethnic, religious, and socio-economic diversity. One of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Cincinnati, it was first settled by the Reverend James Kemper in 1804.Walnut Hills has long been a diverse neighborhood. Situated just east of downtown Cincinnati but on top of the bluff, it was home to upper and middle class White families whose houses often had views of the Ohio and northern Kentucky. Walnut Hills was also home to upper and middle class Black families, becoming Cincinnati’s center for Black commerce and civic life outside of the West End. And Walnut Hills has hosted all kinds of immigrant families — from Appalachians to Italians, from westward-ho Yankees to peoples in the Great Migration. The Walnut Hills Historical Society (WHHS) seeks to preserve and present some of this rich history thru research, interviews, and photographs.</p>
				<p><h3>Kemper Homestead</h3> 
				<p>It is the oldest house in Cincinnati, a two-story log house, and was located between Park Avenue and Kemper Lane north of Windsor Street.</p>

					<h3>evolution of the city</h3>
					<p>Later, wealthy landowners established expansive estates and built housing for their employees. Schools and other training and educational opportunities were established and commerce in the historic Peebles Corner area flourished. From its very beginning, the outstanding characteristic of this area has been the diversity of the residents.</p>

						<h3>A Neighborhood's Journey Through Time</h3>
						<p>Our neighborhood was a key part of the Underground Railroad with resident Harriet Beecher Stowe and with the Lane Seminary hosting abolitionist debates in the mid-19th century.</p>
						<p>During the first half of the 20th century, Peebles Corner, at E McMillan and Gilbert, became known as the second downtown because of its vibrant business district and close proximity to the downtown area.</p><p>At the end of the 20th century for a period of several years, community leaders formed the 45206 Alliance to create a vision for the neighborhood. That plan is still being used today as a guide for current and future development.</p>
						<p>In 2013, the Cincinnati City Planning Commission formally adopted Form-Based Code in Walnut Hills. This type of zoning allows retail, commercial, office, and residential spaces to mix within the same development. Form-based code ensures that new or remodeled structures blend with the historic character of the neighborhood.</p>
